            <h1>About Me Page</h1>
            <p>Hi my name is Hisyam and I am from Terengganu. I was born in 1999, the last date in May to be precise and that makes me 24 this year. I don't really know what to write but I guess I'm just going to share my story on how I ended up here. Coming from a family with engineering background (most of us) had really left me with no choice but to study engineering as well. And that was exactly what I did. I graduated as a civil engineer last year and currently working as an engineer. However, my interest has always been somewhere else. I'm not sure what exactly my passion in life is, nor I know what I really want to do with my life but one thing that I am certain is that I don't really enjoy being an engineer. During my degree, I had picked up some interest in coding since I took a coding class. But they didn't offer a lot so the only thing that I learned was C++ and that's it. I was also into writing but I am not sure if I am good at it but sometimes I enjoy writing stuff. There was a time when I tried to convice my parents to change course for my degree but obviously it didn't work. So after graduating I sucessfully landed a job in a company based in KL as a jr technical engineer and was assign to a condominium project. I worked for 6 days per week and only paid for RM2000 per month. Honestly, that wasn't even close to enough to live in KL. The net pay was actually around Rm1700 and there were bills that I had to pay. Imagine going through life with that digits as an earning. I wasn't living actually, it was more like a survival and I was trying to survive the days. I'm exaggerating atually lol but yeah it was that bad. So I quit and went back to my hometown and started to work with my dad. The pay is okay but I still didn't enjoy the work. One day, when I was scrolling through Twitter, I found an advertisement of coding program by Sigma School. So I went and checked about it and it caught my attention. And that was when I decided to try coding. I talked to my parents again and convince them to let me learn coding this time and it worked. So here I am. Although the progress is quite slow, but I've never stopped learning. It is slow but it is also certain that I will finish this program and get a job in tech industry someday. </p>
